{"name":"Easy-lod","tagline":"","body":"##EASY Metadata as Linked Open Data Demo\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n- Generate an RDF dump of EASY metadata.\r\n- Show off flexibility of SPARQL queries.\r\n- Investigate issues related to publishing metadata as LOD.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nThis is a quick and dirty demo. Choices made are motivated by\r\nthe speed of implementation, nothing is guaranteed to work,\r\neverything is likely to change.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nOAI-PMH endpoint http://easy.dans.knaw.nl/oai/ is used without\r\nauthentication to harvest metadata and store it in n-triples format.\r\n\r\nThe metadata is expressed using DCMI Metadata Terms as in the original\r\ndataset. Datasets are identified by OAI-PMH header identifier, and all\r\nvalues are interpreted as Dutch literals.\r\n\r\nSee `dump.py` for details.\r\n\r\n### Obtaining the Data\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to get the data. \r\n\r\n- Generate a new metadata dump run `python dump.py`.\r\n- Download the dump from http://goo.gl/IOSmC\r\n- Use the public SPARQL endpoint http://dydra.com/cgueret/easy-lod/sparql \r\n\r\n### Licence\r\n\r\nTBC\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
