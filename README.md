# EASY Metadata as Linked Open Data Demo

### Motivation

- Generate an RDF dump of EASY metadata.
- Show off flexibility of SPARQL queries.
- Investigate issues related to publishing metadata as LOD.

### Status
This is a quick and dirty demo. Choices made are motivated by
the speed of implementation, nothing is guaranteed to work,
everything is likely to change.

### Results

The [dump](http://goo.gl/IOSmC) of EASY metadata was generated by the custom
[script](http://github.com/cmarat/easy-lod/blob/master/dump.py)
and loaded into the Dydra
[repository](http://dydra.com/cgueret/easy-lod/sparql). 
EASY metadata is available via the public
[SPARQL endpoint](http://dydra.com/cgueret/easy-lod/sparql). 

Along the data the repository contains sample SPARQL queries:

- [Top 20 subjects describing EASY datasets](http://goo.gl/PNVto)
- [Datasets related to Amsterdam](http://goo.gl/JO5o0)

For more examples see http://dydra.com/cgueret/easy-lod/sparql.

#### Implementation details

To harvest metadata we use the public EASY OAI-PMH
[endpoint](http://easy.dans.knaw.nl/oai/)
without authentication. The data is retrieved in `oai-dc` format and
stored as n-triples using the same schema. Datasets are identified
by OAI-PMH header identifier, and all values are interpreted as Dutch
literals.

See [dump.py](http://github.com/cmarat/easy-lod/blob/master/dump.py) for details.
